# Ghostlight Current System Map

Ghostlight does not have a runtime yet. The live system right now is the repo's
state and re-entry discipline.

## Current Control Flow

1. A user or agent enters the repo with a bounded question or implementation
   goal.
2. The session rehydrates from:
   - `state/map.yaml`
   - `notes/fresh-workspace-handoff.md`
   - this file
   - `notes/ghostlight-implementation-plan.md`
3. The session runs `npm run state:status` to recover the current summary, next
   action, and active subgoals.
4. Work happens in one bounded slice.
5. If understanding changes, the map is updated.
6. If future belief changes, distilled evidence is appended.
7. If compaction pressure rises, the helper audits state hygiene before the
   session banks the fire.

## Live Surfaces

- `state/map.yaml`
  - canonical experiment, objective, constraints, invariants, active subgoals,
    accepted design, and current status
- `state/scratch.md`
  - temporary working memory for one bounded organ
- `state/evidence.jsonl`
  - durable belief-changing records only
- `state/branches.json`
  - explicit hypothesis or branch tracking
- `notes/fresh-workspace-handoff.md`
  - re-entry packet
- `notes/ghostlight-implementation-plan.md`
  - larger-organ sequence
- `docs/research/`
  - research backlog and social-model notes
- `docs/architecture/`
  - world, state, and prompt-system architecture notes
- `tools/ghostlight_state.py`
  - compact state inspection and evidence or branch updates
- `tools/ghostlight_prepare_compaction.py`
  - pre-compaction audit of required files, handoff content, and git hygiene

## What Does Not Exist Yet

- a canonical agent-state schema
- a classifier pipeline
- a prompt renderer
- a simulation/event loop
- a relationship engine
- a culture prior engine

That absence is not a bug. It is just the current phase. The repo now owns the
theory body cleanly, even if the runtime skeleton is still missing.

# Ghostlight Current System Map

Ghostlight does not have a full runtime yet. The live system is a set of
validated artifact seams for producing reviewed training data.

## Control Flow

1. Rehydrate from `state/map.yaml`, `notes/fresh-workspace-handoff.md`, this
   file, and `notes/ghostlight-implementation-plan.md`.
2. Run `npm run state:status`.
3. Work one bounded organ.
4. Validate the seam that matters.
5. Persist only belief-changing evidence.
6. Commit and push completed work.

## Core Surfaces

- `state/map.yaml`: canonical mission, boundaries, live architecture, next action.
- `state/evidence.jsonl`: distilled belief-changing evidence only.
- `state/evidence.archive.jsonl`: older evidence preserved for archaeology.
- `state/corpus-coverage.json`: accepted/planned fixture coverage ledger.
- `notes/fresh-workspace-handoff.md`: compact re-entry packet.
- `notes/ghostlight-implementation-plan.md`: near-term implementation sequence.
- `docs/architecture/`: detailed contracts and rationale.

## Active Artifact Pipeline

```text
Aetheria lore/source context
  -> lore grounding digest / source notes
  -> canonical agent and scene state
  -> projected local context
  -> responder packet
  -> sandboxed responder output
  -> review and leakage audit
  -> observable event record
  -> participant-local appraisal receipts
  -> mutation receipt
  -> updated scene/world/social state
  -> initiative schedule updates readiness, reaction windows, and next actor
  -> sandboxed coordinator continuity and next-beat plan
  -> meta-coordinator review, wiring, and labeled interventions
  -> branch compiler materializes Ink + sidecar + visual plan + compiler notes
  -> IF artifact reviewer audits consequence, fold, and visual continuity
  -> narrative/lore/spatial/visual reviewers audit player-facing quality
  -> accepted fixture / future training corpus + optional illustrated replay collateral
```

Responder packets are one seam, not the whole project. The branching scene path
also requires coordinator receipts, branch compiler artifacts, and independent
review before a fixture is accepted.

Tone is a live seam. The system should preserve Aetheria's range instead of
defaulting to dry technical crisis prose: comic warmth, domestic routine,
ritual memory, weird bureaucracy, noir suspicion, wonder, horror, poetic dread,
and procedural systems pressure are all valid when source-grounded and
character-local. Adams/Pratchett-style wit-with-stakes is a useful default
touchstone for counterbalancing bleakness without dissolving consequence.

Visual replay is a presentation seam, not a core social-model training seam.
Illustrated IF fixtures need click-through sections with stable
`visual_scene_id` anchors, stable visual character refs for recurring named
characters, a global style cue when the visual language matters, imagegen-ready
base prompts, character visibility and stance controls, and branch/state
modifiers. This data belongs in a separate `.visual.json` artifact referenced
by the training sidecar, not inside the training annotation itself.

Generated images are not geometry authority. They can establish visual mood,
materials, and concept direction, but multi-angle illustrated IF needs a durable
`scene_set` source such as a hand-built 3D blockout, procedural scene file, or
layout asset with named cameras and staging slots. For those scenes, imagegen is
the painter/render pass over a camera-specific blockout, not the architect of
the room.

## Current Live Examples

Pallas Species Strikes is the active reference-only story fixture:

- `examples/lore-grounding/pallas-species-strikes.awakened-labor.v0.json`
- `examples/agent-state.pallas-species-strikes.v0.json`
- `examples/coordinator/pallas-species-strikes.branch-and-fold.v0.json`
- `examples/ink/pallas-species-strikes.branch-and-fold.v0.ink`
- `examples/ink/pallas-species-strikes.branch-and-fold.v0.training.json`
- `examples/visual/pallas-species-strikes.branch-and-fold.v0.visual.json`
- `experiments/pallas-species-strikes/pallas-species-strikes.branch-and-fold-clean-run.v0.md`
- `experiments/pallas-species-strikes/pallas-species-strikes.visual-scene-review.v1.json`

The fixture is not training-ready data for Ghostlight's model stages. It was
coordinator-authored without the exact projected-context, sandboxed responder,
appraisal, mutation, relationship-update, and true branch-compiler receipts
those stages require. Keep it as a reference for story shape, grounding,
branch-and-fold presentation, visual planning, and future fixture expectations.

`pallas-training-loop-v0` is the first separate training-shaped derivative. It
rebuilds only the Kappa threshold beat through actual receipts:

- scene digest and initial state under `examples/training-loops/pallas-training-loop-v0/`
- projected contexts under `examples/projected-contexts/`
- responder packets under `examples/responder-packets/`
- raw no-fork subagent captures under `experiments/responder-packets/`
- event, appraisal, mutation, review, and bundle receipts under `examples/training-loops/pallas-training-loop-v0/`
- clean readable transcript under `experiments/pallas-training-loop-v0/`

It is training-shaped for projector, responder, event resolver, participant
appraiser, mutator, relationship/perception updater, and coordinator/story
runtime. It is not branch compiler, IF reviewer, visual, or accepted full-fixture
coverage data.

`lucent-hostage-feed-v0` is the current open-ended training-loop draft. It
tests the same receipt-chain organs in a less reference-bound scene: a Lucent
Media hostage-feed negotiation inside the media-eye counterweight of a tethered
station staring down at a metropolis bubble.

The Lucent bundle includes:

- scene digest, initial state, and branch surface under `examples/training-loops/lucent-hostage-feed-v0/`
- projected contexts under `examples/projected-contexts/`
- responder packets under `examples/responder-packets/`
- raw no-fork subagent captures under `experiments/responder-packets/`
- event, appraisal, mutation, review, and bundle receipts under `examples/training-loops/lucent-hostage-feed-v0/`
- clean readable transcript under `experiments/lucent-hostage-feed-v0/`
- fixture materializer at `scripts/materialize_lucent_loop.py`
- initiative schedule example at
  `examples/initiative/lucent-hostage-feed-v0.turn-20.initiative.json`

Only the fifteen post-restart turns from `turn-06` through `turn-20` are counted
as training-clean responder receipts. The earlier exploratory opening turns are
setup/rehearsal context. The loop demonstrates state carryover: feed evidence
externalization creates breathing room, breathing room creates a bench-edge
substitution, the substitution enables a process-note admission, the admission
enables direct hostage leverage to end, and release folds into safe-line
confirmation plus non-contact protective handoff.

The current coordinator lesson is explicit: nudge through game-ergonomic state
levers rather than forcing plot. Safe lines, evidence locks, security holds,
handling categories, posture constraints, route access, clocks, public proof
objects, and resource pressure are the elastic strings. Actors pull against
those strings from local state; the coordinator records observed action and
folds consequences through reviewed mutation.

The coordinator must now be treated as a sandboxable organ in future
training-shaped loops. Codex remains the meta-coordinator: it prepares visible
input, launches the coordinator worker, reviews the output, labels repairs, and
wires structured state between organs. Raw coordinator training data should come
from sandboxed coordinator prompts, not from omniscient chat steering.

The initiative scheduler is now an explicit mechanical seam. It decides when an
actor is eligible to act from initiative speed, recovery, load, status, and
reaction windows; it does not decide what the actor wants or how other
participants appraise the event. Every affected participant still appraises and
mutates before the scheduler selects the next projected actor.

## Pruned Receipts

Old prototype fixture receipts and model-runner files have been removed
from the live workspace. Their useful lessons belong in the architecture docs,
state map, evidence ledger, and git history. Do not reintroduce deleted receipt
paths as active state surfaces.

## Missing Or Incomplete Organs

- Deterministic speaker-local input slicer
- Full prompt renderer
- Classifier/appraiser pipeline
- Relationship/perception updater
- State mutator model
- Student projector
- Runtime integration for initiative scheduling beyond validated artifacts
- Branch compiler implementation beyond coordinator-authored fixtures
- IF artifact reviewer implementation beyond manual/frontier review
- Visual scene continuity reviewer implementation beyond prompted specialist review
- Full scene/event loop implementation
- Culture prior engine
- Automatic promotion of branch outcomes into canonical state
- Corpus coverage ledger expansion beyond the current draft Pallas and Lucent
  receipt-chain rows

## Current North Star

Generate high-quality, sandboxed, source-grounded branching-scene samples that
can later train specialized Ghostlight models while staying usable by a game
engine: exact inputs, exact outputs, provenance, review labels, state mutation
receipts, branch compiler artifacts, IF review findings, visual scene plans, and
clear branch consequences. The samples should also train tonal control: a
fixture needs an intentional prose mode and enough ordinary life for consequence
to matter.

Use `npm run coverage:status` before choosing new fixtures so the corpus grows
by coverage need instead of proximity to the nearest interesting disaster.
